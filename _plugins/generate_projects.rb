# Generator that creates project pages for jekyll sites from git repositories.
#
# This was inspired by the project pages on GitHub, which use the project README file as the index
# page. It takes git repositories, and automatically builds project pages for them using the README
# file, along with downloadable zipped copies of the projects themselves (for example, the project
# page for this "plugin repository":http://recursive-design.com/projects/jekyll-plugins/ is
# auto-generated with this plugin).
#
# To use it, simply drop this script into the _plugins directory of your Jekyll site. Next, create a
# *_projects* folder in the base of your jekyll site. This folder should contain .yml files describing
# how to build a page for your project. Here is an example jekyll-plugins.yml (note: you should remove
# the leading '# ' characters):
#
# ================================== COPY BELOW THIS LINE ==================================
# layout:     default
# title:      Jekyll Plugins
# repository: git://recursive-design.com/jekyll-plugins.git
# published:  true
# ================================== COPY ABOVE THIS LINE ==================================
#
# There is also an optional 'zip_folder_name' setting, in case you want the unzipped folder to be named
# something other than the project name. This is useful (for eaxmple) if you want it to unzip as an
# OS X 'Something.app' application bundle.
#
# When you compile your jekyll site, the plugin will download the git repository of each project
# in your _projects folder, create an index page from the README (using the specified layout),
# and create a downloadable .zip file of the project. The goal is to automate the construction of
# online project pages, keep them in sync with README documentation, and provide an up-to-date zip
# archive for download.
#
# Required files :
# Your project's git repository should contain:
# - README:       The contents of this will be used as the body of your project page will be created
#                 from. Any extension other than .markdown, .textile or .html will be treated as a
#                 .textile file.
# - versions.txt: Contains the version string (eg 1.0.0). Used when naming the downloadable zip-file
#                 (optional). If the version.txt file is not available, a YYYYMMDDHHMM timestamp will
#                 be used for the version.
#
# Required gems :
# - git     (>= 1.2.5)
# - rubyzip (>= 0.9.4)
#
# Available _config.yml settings :
# - project_dir: The subfolder to compile projects to (default is 'projects').
#
# Available YAML settings :
# - repository: Git repository of your project (required).
# - layout: Layout to use when creating the project page.
# - title: Project title, which can be accessed in the layout.
# - published: Project won't be published if this is false.

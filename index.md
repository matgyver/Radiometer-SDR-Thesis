## Software Defined Radiometer website

This website covers the research I have done in a software defined radiometer.  This project was done in part for my thesis and part of the requirement for my Masters in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.  

This website will contain some information and is a project page in GitHub.  It is located in the same repository that also houses the original LaTeX files for the thesis and also any source code used in the experiments.  You can find this repository here {{site.github.repository_url}}

## General Information
The following pages is general information about how the Software Defined Radiometer works.  This includes links to setting up and configuring the software used and other general information about the system.

### Parsing Data using iPython Notebook
The following page walks through an example of parsing data from the radiometer using iPython Notebook.  The result are two graphs, one plotting the raw rQ values and the other showing how having two calibration points, we can calibrate the radiometer and graph that.

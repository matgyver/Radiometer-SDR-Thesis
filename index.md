## Software Defined Radiometer website

This website covers the research I have done in a software defined radiometer.  This project was done in part for my thesis and part of the requirement for my Masters in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.  

This website will contain some information and is a project page in GitHub.  It is located in the same repository that also houses the original LaTeX files for the thesis and also any source code used in the experiments.  You can find this repository here {{site.github.repository_url}}

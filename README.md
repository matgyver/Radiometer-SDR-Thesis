# RFGeeks website

In July 2014 I moved the RFGeeks website to GitHub using Jekyll.  This repos of course holds the source files that build the static pages for RFGeeks.  In addition the original site over on Google Sites will remain for reference as well at <http://sites.google.com/site/rfgeeks>.  

## Changelog

Changelog will go here once the site stabilizes.  

## Version

0.1 - Initial site
0.2 - Added information and main page


## Information


What is RFGeeks?  It is the personal website for Matthew Nelson.  Through this website I often document projects I am working on and blog things that I think are interesting.  The topics may vary, but will probably be about electrical and computer engineering, education, programming, embedded systems, high altitude ballooning, robotics, amateur radio and probably even about flying.

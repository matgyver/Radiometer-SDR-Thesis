{"name":"RFGeeks.com","tagline":"Welcome to RFGeeks","body":"### Welcome to RFGeeks.com.\r\nWelcome to the new website for RFGeeks.com!\r\n\r\nWhat is RFGeeks.com?  It is a website that will talk about electronics, computers, gaming, amateur radio, high altitude balloons, UAVs, robotics and more.  It is basically a reflection of my interests or things I am involved in in addition to the projects I do, the classes I teach and the research I do.  In addition, some personal projects of mine will be posted here as well.\r\n\r\nLink to my GitHub profile: @matgyver\r\n\r\nSo I hope you enjoy the new site.  This site will be a work in progress as I get used to using GitHub's user pages and using Jekyll to publish content.  But hopefully this will result in more updates and you will see more what my projects and research covers.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-4883943-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

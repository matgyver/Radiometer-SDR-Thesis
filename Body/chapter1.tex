This thesis explores using software defined radio (SDR) technology to develop a radiometer that is on par with a traditional radiometer.  In addition to demonstrating a SDR-based radiometer can achieve similar performance, in terms of sensitivity and stability, to a traditional radiometer, it is shown that the inherent flexibility of SDR technology allows implementing functionality beyond what a traditional radiometer typically provides.  Furthermore, by reducing cost and increasing flexibility, SDR technology may become an attractive path for broadening the accessibility of radiometry to the general research community.

%This thesis looks to explore the following questions: (1) Can we use an off the shelf SDR along with GNURadio to recreate a radiometer in software that is easy to use and cost effective?  (2) If so, what performance can we get from the system?  (3) What benefits do we gain (if any) from using a SDR from a more traditional radiometer? The results of this research and experimentation are the subject of this thesis.

\emph{Motivation.}  Remote sensing refers to activities of recording, observing and perceiving objects or events that are far away (i.e. remote)[\cite{weng2012}].  Since the object of interest is remote, we cannot physically interact with it using local measurement methods such as placing sensors or probes on the object.  Remote sensing can be accomplished in a variety of ways and the list below is the basic types of radiometry that is used today.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Visible light: Photography and Photogrammetry,
\item Thermal: Far infrared,
\item Laser distance measurement; Lidar,
\item Radio Frequency (RF): Radiometry.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these methods above has an associated set of pros and cons, thus remote sensing often uses a combination of methods to paint a complete picture of an object.  This thesis focuses on the apparatus used in radiometry to capture RF signals, called a radiometer.

Radiometry can be broken in to two methods; active or passive.  An active system is one in which a radio frequency signal or pulse is generated and transmitted to the object of interest.  The reflection of this RF signal, or in some cases lack of reflection, gives us information about the object.  A passive system is one in which no RF signal or pulse is generated.  Instead, this type of radiometer simply listens to the RF energy that is naturally generated by the object or that may be reflected from another source, such as the Sun.  Additional applications include: assessing vegetation health and observing celestial objects[\cite{ulaby2014}].  Radiometers have been focused on Earth for such purposes as helping scientists better understand its water cycle by monitoring ocean salinity [\cite{Hardy}] and soil moisture [\cite{Liu}].  Radiometers such as these are already in service on satellites such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite [\cite{McMullan}] launched by the European Space Agency (ESA).

The amount of noise that is generated by the object of interest is due to the thermal agitation of the charge carriers, usually the electrons, which is directly correlated to the physical temperature of the source [\cite{Nyquist1928thermal}].  It is because of this correlation that we often refer to the amount of noise received as the noise temperature and it is measured in Kelvins.

\emph{Problem Statement.}  While radiometers have proved to be an excellent tool for remote sensing and have been used in research applications for over fifty years, they have not made it into wide spread use.  This is due to the fact that many traditional radiometers have the following hurdles:

\begin{enumerate}
\item They are expensive,
\item They require advanced knowledge to implement and use,
\item They are typically built and designed for a custom application.
\end{enumerate}

This thesis aims to help address each of these hurdles as follows.  The use of commercial of the shelf (COTS) parts and solutions will help reduce cost and the need for a custom design.  The use of a software to define key components of the radiometer eliminates the need for a custom build and allows for a flexible system for multiple applications.  The use of a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) reduces the need of advanced knowledge to implement and use the radiometer. 


\emph{Contributions.}  The primary contributions of this thesis work are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Development of a software defined radio-based radiometer
\item Python based scripts for analyzing data generated by the radiometer
\item A Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)mitigation technique implemented using software defined radio technology
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Organization.}  The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows.  Chapter \ref{ch:relatedworks} gives a discussion of related works.  Chapter \ref{ch:background} gives background on traditional radiometers and on software defined radios.  Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} presents details on how software defined radio technology was used to implement a radiometer.  Chapter \ref{ch:exp_design} describes the experimentation setup used to verify and evaluate the operation of the implemented radiometer.  Chapter \ref{ch:results} examines the results obtained from our performance evaluation experiments.  Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the thesis and outlines avenues of future work.

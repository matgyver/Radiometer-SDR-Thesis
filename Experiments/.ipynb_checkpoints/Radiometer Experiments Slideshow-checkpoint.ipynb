    "Experiment 1 was designed to show normal operation of a software defined radio as a radiometer.  It shows how both the software defined radio works and the square-law detector that was used to validate the information collected.  It also shows calibration of the data to a noise temperature which is typical for most radiometer applications.  Finally an example of using this in a real world application, soil moisture, is also shown."

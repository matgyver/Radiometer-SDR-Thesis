Colorline module

This module uses the definations from David P. Sanders to build a module that allows us to color a line in matplotlib.  This utilizies the LineCollection from Matplotlib and this module makes it a little easier to use those.

You can find examples of using this code on his Github site located here - http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dpsanders/matplotlib-examples/blob/master/colorline.ipynb

# Topics: line, color, LineCollection, cmap, colorline, codex
'''
Defines a function colorline that draws a (multi-)colored 2D line with coordinates x and y.
The color is taken from optional data in z, and creates a LineCollection.

z can be:
- empty, in which case a default coloring will be used based on the position along the input arrays
- a single number, for a uniform color [this can also be accomplished with the usual plt.plot]
- an array of the length of at least the same length as x, to color according to this data
- an array of a smaller length, in which case the colors are repeated along the curve

The function colorline returns the LineCollection created, which can be modified afterwards.

# Data manipulation:

    Create list of line segments from x and y coordinates, in the correct format for LineCollection:
    an array of the form   numlines x (points per line) x 2 (x and y) array

# Interface to LineCollection:

    Plot a colored line with coordinates x and y

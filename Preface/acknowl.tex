\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to those
who helped me with various aspects of conducting research and the writing
of this thesis.
First and foremost, Dr. Phillip Jones for his guidance, patience and support throughout this research and the writing of this thesis.
I would also like to thank Dr. John Basart who patiently spent many hours with me going over both the fundamentals and details with radiometers.
I would like to thank Dr. Brian Hornbuckle for his continued support and for allowing me to utilize his radiometer, lab and students towards my research.  
Finally I would like to thank Dr. Mani Mina who not only was instrumental in my undergraduate career but continued his support into my graduate path as well.  If it was not for Dr. Mina hiring me as the Chief Engineer of the Spacecraft Systems and Operations Lab, I would not be here today.

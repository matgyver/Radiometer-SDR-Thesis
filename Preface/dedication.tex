\chapter*{DEDICATION}

I would like to dedicate this thesis to my wife Jennifer who has stood by me through this long journey towards my Masters.  She put up with my countless afternoons that I was gone working on my thesis and also helped edit my thesis.  

I would also like to thank my parents without whose support I would not have been able to complete this work.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for their continued support and constant encouragement.

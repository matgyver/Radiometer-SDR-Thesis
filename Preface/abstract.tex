This thesis explores using a software defined radio (SDR) to create a SDR-based radiometer that is capable of performing the same operation of a traditional radiometer and offers additional capabilities not found in traditional radiometers.  Radiometers are very sensitive and a traditional radiometer requires careful design to ensure optimal performance.  By digitizing the RF signal as soon as possible and processing this signal in software, the design of the radiometer is simplified.

Digital radiometers have been explored before, but often use customized components.  Software defined radio technology has become more widespread and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) SDRs are now available with high performance but at an affordable cost.  This thesis will use a COTS SDR to build our SDR-based radiometer.  This will lower the cost of the radiometer and make radiometers more accessible to a wider audience.  

Discussed in this thesis is how parts of a traditional radiometer is emulated in software.  This is then verified through experimentation that compares data collected from a SDR-based radiometer and a traditional radiometer.  The results of this thesis is that our SDR-based radiometer performs as well as a traditional radiometer and offers additional features that are not found in a traditional radiometer.
